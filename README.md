# Dog-Image-Classifier
This is my first project on GitHub, using an image classifier to identify dog breeds

# Description:
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant who registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based on the biographical information.
Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.
You need to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.
